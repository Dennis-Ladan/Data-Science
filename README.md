This repository contains a curated selection of Data Science and Computer Vision projects, each representing a crucial phase in my skill development and practical application of knowledge acquired at World Quant University. These projects were integral components of their rigorous and structured learning programs, designed to foster deep understanding and problem-solving capabilities. My work here clearly demonstrates a high level of proficiency in a diverse range of supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, from building predictive models using classification and regression algorithms to uncovering hidden patterns through advanced clustering and dimensionality reduction. In the realm of computer vision, these projects range from fundamental image analysis and manipulation to the development of more sophisticated applications like real-time object detection systems, precise image segmentation, and highly accurate image classification models. Every solution presented in this repository was conceived, developed, and validated within the challenging academic framework of the university, underscoring my commitment to delivering technically sound and impactful data-driven solutions.
